# LeetCode


Solve problems from [Leetcode](http://oj.leetcode.com/). All the codes are tested using online-judge.

Here is a [difficulty and frequency distribution chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aqt--%20wSNYfuxdGxQWVFsOGdVVWxQRlNUVXZTdEpOeEE&output=html) for each problem, which I got from the Internet and is very useful.

Please feel free to let me know if you have any problem or better solutions:)

**Note**: The problem link in the file will take you to the Old OJ, which will expire on October 12, 12pm PST.<br>
You may use [this link](http://oj.leetcode.com/) to the new OJ instead!
