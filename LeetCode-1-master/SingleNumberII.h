 Problem:    Single Number II
 Difficulty: Easy
 Source:     http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/
 Notes:
 Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. 
 Find that single one.
 Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it 
 without using extra memory?

 Solution: Count the number of each bit.
