Maximizing XOR
==============

Given two integers **L** and **R**, find the maximal values of **A xor B âˆ€ L <= A <= B <= R**.

### Input:

The input contains two lines, **L** is present in thefirst line.  **R** in the second.

### Output:

The maximal value as mentioned in the problem statement.

### Constraints:

* 1 <= **L** <= **R** <= 10<sup>3</sup>

### Sample Input:

    1
    10

### Sample Output:

    15

### Explanation:

The maximum value can be obtained for A = 5 and B = 10,

1010 xor 0101 = 1111 hence 15.
